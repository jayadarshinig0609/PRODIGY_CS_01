"The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in a text is shifted by a specific number of positions in the alphabet. This Python program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm, supporting both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. It provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input their message and a shift value to perform encryption or decryption, making it a practical tool for learning basic cryptography."
